Our success is based on our reputation for quality and freshness, which we've maintained since opening our first store.

     <p style="text-align: right;">Claire has always loved designing and decorating cakes,
        having joined the company in 2009 she has been working
        hard to develop our much loved “house style”.

        As creative director of the company Claire designs all
        of the cakes produced from the client’s initial idea.
        Claire’s background was studying fine art in Brighton
        and she loves the creative process of designing a cake.
        
        Her cakes begin life in her sketchbooks which are full of
        colour swatches, patterns, drawings and inspirations.
        Her love of photography goes hand-in hand with her cakes
        and she can often been seen snapping away on her camera!
        It is Claire’s aim to ensure that the company remains at
        the cutting edge of cake design in Scotland.</p>
