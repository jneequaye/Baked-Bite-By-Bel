                </span>

<h1>The Genesis Of Baked-Bites-By-Bel</h1>
<p>Our love affair with cakes began back in 2002 when we opened our first Cakes
    & Bakes branch in San Antonio, Texas, USA. Ever since opening our first store
    to the public in 2002 Baked-Bites-By-Bel has been going from strength to strength.
    At Baked-Bites-By-Bel we believe in providing only the freshest and most delicious
    cakes to our customers. Our success is based on our reputation for quality and
    freshness, which we've maintained since opening our first store. Whether you're
    looking for a stunning fresh cream, buttercream, or fondant whole cake, cupcakes,
    or something savory, we have something perfect for you.
