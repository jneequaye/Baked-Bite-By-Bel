        Yum! This place has THE BEST buttercream frosting anywhere!! Went to
        the open house today and tried out some of their new goodies!
        The polvorones are excellent not to
        mention the butter cookies! If you haven’t been….
        RUN to The Cake Shop and my girls there will take care of you!!!

        I needed a personalized cake on very short notice for my cousin’s
        step-son’s birthday. Not only did I receive a very delicious,
        inexpensive cake…the staff went above and beyond to make it happen.
        The party was a success and all of the kids loved the cake.
        Thanks to the staff for saving the day! I highly recommend this place!

    <h3>Birthday Section</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        The Cake Shop is awesome they have made me more then 10 cakes for all my cake smashes.
        My little clients love the cakes and the parents to when the child doesn’t finish it
        the parents are able to take the cake home so they know where I buy the cakes.
        They haven’t disappointed me yet and they are spot on with the designs that I bring them for my sessions!
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>List item one</li>
        <li>List item two</li>
        <li>List item three</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Weddings Section</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        We always get our cakes from The Cake Shop. Love the taste and the cakes always look amazing.
        My granddaughter’s Barbie birthday cake today looked fabulous. Thank you so much!!

        I got to experience The Cake Shop will planning my wedding. While the wedding did not go through,
        the staff was incredibly professional to offer the deposit in the form of a gift card to be used later.
        This is EXACTLY what would make me stay with this business and refer them to everyone I know.
        Companies that do the right thing and understand life happens are the kind of companies that are perfect
        examples of what caring about customers is all about.
        I can’t wait to get more from them. Can I also say that their Cookies and Creme cake is INCREDIBLE!!!!.
